# EnigmaCrypt
EnigmaCrypt is a Python package that provides a simple and secure way to encrypt and decrypt strings. It uses a unique encryption algorithm and generates a key that can be used to decode the encrypted string.

## Installation
To install EnigmaCrypt, you can use pip:

```pip install enigmacrypt```

## Usage
Here's a simple example of how to use EnigmaCrypt to encrypt and decrypt a string:

```python
from enigmacrypt import EnigmaCrypt

# Create an instance of EnigmaCrypt
crypt = EnigmaCrypt()

# Encrypt a string
encrypted_string, key = crypt.encrypt("Hello, World!")

# Decrypt the string using the generated key
decrypted_string = crypt.decrypt(encrypted_string, key)

print(decrypted_string)  # Output: Hello, World!
```
